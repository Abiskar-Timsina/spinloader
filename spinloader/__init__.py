__VERSION__ = "0.0.0.1"
__DESCRIPTION__=""" This is a project I've been working on over the weekend. It's a very simple project that'll show a spinloader for a running function. 
It's really simple to use. Just use the @animate decorator above the function and It'll take care of the rest. I also tried to incorperate some niche features that i tend 
to use. 
1. Custom Colors for cosole 
2. Timeout for threads 
3. Return values are captured by threads. 

I'll keep working on making this better in the future. This won't work well on windows and, I've only tested it on arch linux.
